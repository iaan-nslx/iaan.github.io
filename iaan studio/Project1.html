    The building in Berlin-Mitte was designed by the architect Hans Heinrich Müller in 1928 and was built to house distribution facilities. The listed building was later used as a substation and has been disused since 1998. Its facade of red blend brick and the vertical bands of narrow windows, behind which a sculptural staircase leads to the utility storeys, are clearly visible from Neue Grünstrasse as the original front building no longer exists.

    The transformation envisages a change of use in the former substation and its grounds into an art gallery. The building will be gutted so that steel skeletons, stacked on top of each other, can be inserted. The basic layout contains three double-storeys consisting of a slightly raised ground floor and two exhibition spaces above, each consisting of a full floor and a gallery floor. The architectural concept is twofold: it is based on the preservation of the facade and the staircase with industrial glazing, which is typical for the period, and on creating mainly neutral spaces at the rear. Along with the renovations in line with heritage protection requirements, the necessary structural improvements and the installation of building services, special attention was paid to the gallery spaces, their surfaces, lighting, fixtures and fittings as well as the fenced in grounds.
