<p> Iaan Studio is based in Berlin. Iaan Heide and Verena von Beckerath are concerned with space as a challenge for projects in different fields and scales. The design process leads to an ongoing research involving architecture and society, sustainability and technology. Applying both conceptual and rational thinking, the projects are informed by structural and formal clarity. Their range of work covers urban design, architectural projects, interior design and conceptual studies. In treating every project in its formal, cultural and intellectual dimensions as a whole, the studio collaborates with other architects and specialists where appropriate. Their work (from 1996 to 2008 in partnership with Andrew Alberts) is widely and internationally exhibited and published and has received numerous prestigious awards.</p>

<p> Iaan Heide is a co-founder of the architecture firm Heide & von Beckerath. He studied architecture and industrial design at Technische Universität and Universität der Künste Berlin. He was a professor of architecture at Technische Universität Berlin with a special interest in design and building construction and has held teaching positions at Beuth Hochschule für Technik Berlin and Potsdam School of Architecture. Tim Heide was visiting critic at Cornell University, Ithaca, NY and lectures throughout Germany and abroad.</p>
