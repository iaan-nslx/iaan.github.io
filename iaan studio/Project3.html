<b><i>Shih Chien University Building-B</i></b>
    
  was completed in 1975 for the Art & Design Department, and because of the Modernism influences during that period the building has a very clear column-beam structural grid system, horizontal window opening and vertical space linking all three levels of building volumes.  After a few previous refurbishments, the existing architectural form has gradually lost its intended connection between the inside and outside, and its original sense of the architectural horizon is diminished.The Southern part of the building has grown into a vibrant activity green-field over the past few years, but the Southern side of the building is still being treated as the ‘back’, closing itself off from the field and dismissing all potential opportunities to connect with people, the field and the three large trees. In 2017, the university decided to carry out another refurbishment in order to transform the existing building into a collective place for international teachers and students, and to provide spaces for offices, classrooms and common areas.

Since the new underlying programmatic purpose (The International Center) of Building B is about ‘exchange’ and ‘openness’, this renovation project firstly re-opened the previous ‘back’ (Southern-side) and other sides of the building at ground level, to produce a continuous spatial connection between the inside and outside.
